        by <a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish">powerlanguage</a>.<br/><br/>

        This implementation is largely based on <a href="https://github.com/lynn">@chordbug</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/lynn/hello-wordl">hello-wordl</a>.<br/><br/>

        Instead of guessing words based on their English spelling, in <i>{appName}</i> you guess words based on their pronunciation in North American English.
        Pronunciations have been taken from the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a> and may not match your exact dialect.
        Certain phonological features like aspiration are not represented here to make it easier; whatever phonemes are available on the keyboard are the ones that this game accepts.

        After each guess, you get Mastermind-style feedback.
